# Intelligent Cloud Waste Detector

> AI-powered AWS resource waste detection and optimization system

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Intelligent Cloud Waste Detector is a comprehensive cloud cost optimization solution that automatically analyzes AWS resource usage patterns, predicts future waste, and generates actionable recommendations for cost reduction.

## 📊 Current Status (Week 1 - COMPLETED ✅)

### Architecture
- **Region:** ap-south-1 (Mumbai)
- **Cost:** $0.05 total spend (99.9% free tier compliance)
- **Processing:** Automated every 6 hours
- **Analytics:** Weekly comprehensive reports

### Completed Features
- ✅ Automated cost data collection and processing
- ✅ Intelligent waste detection with 6 algorithms
- ✅ DynamoDB storage for usage data and recommendations
- ✅ EventBridge scheduling for automated processing
- ✅ Advanced analytics with ML feature preparation
- ✅ Cost trend analysis and anomaly detection

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
AWS Cost Reports → S3 → EventBridge → Lambda → DynamoDB → Analytics Reports
```

### Core Components
1. **Data Collection:** Automated Cost & Usage Reports
2. **Processing:** Lambda functions with sophisticated algorithms
3. **Storage:** DynamoDB for structured data, S3 for analytics
4. **Intelligence:** 6 waste detection algorithms with confidence scoring
5. **Automation:** EventBridge scheduling for hands-free operation

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **AWS Services:** Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge, IAM, Cost & Usage Reports
- **Runtime:** Python 3.12
- **Data Processing:** CSV parsing, batch processing, real-time analysis
- **ML Preparation:** Feature engineering for time series forecasting
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch logs, budget alerts, performance tracking

## 📈 Waste Detection Algorithms

1. **EC2 Low Utilization Detection** - Identifies underutilized compute instances
2. **Storage Over-Provisioning Analysis** - Detects excessive storage allocation
3. **Idle Resource Identification** - Finds resources with minimal activity
4. **Regional Cost Optimization** - Suggests geographical consolidation
5. **Instance Type Optimization** - Recommends right-sizing
6. **Cost Anomaly Detection** - Identifies unusual spending patterns

## 💰 Cost Optimization

- **Current Spend:** $0.05 USD (one-time cost analysis tools)
- **Infrastructure Cost:** $0.00 USD (perfect free tier compliance)
- **Monthly Projection:** <$1.00 USD
- **Free Tier Usage:** <1% across all services

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with free tier
- IAM permissions for Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge
- Python 3.12+ for local development

### Quick Setup
1. Deploy Lambda functions from `src/lambda-functions/`
2. Configure DynamoDB tables as per `config/aws-config.yaml`
3. Set up EventBridge rules for automation
4. Enable Cost & Usage Reports delivery to S3

### Configuration
All configuration is centralized in `config/` directory:
- `aws-config.yaml` - AWS service configuration
- `project-settings.yaml` - Project timeline and features
