# Checkpoint 12 Summary - Enhanced Waste Detection & Alerting

## Overview

In this checkpoint, we enhanced the core cost data processing Lambda function (`cwd-data-collector.py`) to incorporate advanced waste detection logic and real-time alerting via AWS SNS. This strengthens proactive cost monitoring and timely notification to stakeholders.

---

## Key Deliverables

- **Improved Waste Detection Algorithms:**
  - Added multiple heuristics including low EC2 utilization, storage cost optimization, idle resource detection, regional cost awareness, instance size utilization checks, and daily cost trend alerts.
  - Calculated a composite wastage score to prioritize recommendations with associated confidence scores.

- **Waste Alert Logging:**
  - Added detailed logging of waste alerts with resource identifiers, cost, wastage score, and priority level for better traceability.

- **CloudWatch Metric Publishing:**
  - Integrated `put_metric_data` API calls to publish a custom CloudWatch metric (`WasteAlertCount`) every time a waste recommendation is generated.
  - This metric enables near real-time monitoring and automated alarm triggering.

- **SNS Alert Integration:**
  - Created and linked a CloudWatch Alarm on the `WasteAlertCount` metric to an SNS Topic.
  - Developed a separate Lambda (`cwd-prediction-alert`) triggered by the prediction runner, to send alert emails via SNS when high-cost forecasts are detected.

- **Testing & Validation:**
  - Successfully tested enhanced Lambda function and alerting flow with sample data.
  - Verified receipt of SNS alert emails upon waste alert generation.

## Impact & Benefits

- Real-time, automated detection of inefficient cloud resource usage.
- Prompt notifications allow teams to investigate and act swiftly to optimize costs.
- Enhanced logging improves auditing and transparency of cost-saving recommendations.
- CloudWatch integration enables scalable monitoring without manual intervention.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to **Checkpoint 13**: Real-Time Monitoring Integration.
- Develop dashboards and notification workflows for comprehensive operational visibility.
- Optimize waste detection thresholds based on historical alert data.
